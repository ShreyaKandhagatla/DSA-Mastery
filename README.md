# DSA-Mastery
My DSA Journey
This repository contains my complete journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

I've organized topic-wise questions with my own Python solutions, clear explanations, and logic breakdowns — all written in a way that helped me actually understand the concepts, not just memorize them.

I created this repo to track my progress, revise quickly before interviews, and help others who are also preparing for placements or want to strengthen their DSA foundations.

Topics covered include:
✅ Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
✅ Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
✅ Recursion, Sorting, Searching
✅ Sliding Window, Hashing, Bit Manipulation, DP, and more......
